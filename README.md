# Chrome CSV Viewer

This is a chrome extension that provides a tabular UI for viewing csv files, especially raw csv files in github or other repos.

<img src="csv_table.png" width="500px"/>

It currently enables the following functionality:
1. column sorting with direction indicator
2. floating header (as the page scrolls)
3. manually adjusting column widths

It works for any sole csv content page.
